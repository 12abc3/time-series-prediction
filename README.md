Developing weighted models for fuzzy time series prediction

Using the coventional Chen's Model to compare against.
Working on developing a model that would take two things into consideration that was left out by the Chen's model:
  1) Recurring Fuzzy relationships
  2) Assigning weights to fuzzy relationships according to their importance.
